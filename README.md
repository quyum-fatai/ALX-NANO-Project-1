## Introduction
> First project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program which focuses on the turn up rate of patients for their respective appointments

### Dataset Description 
> The dataset contains above 100k data about medical appointments in Brazil, indicating whether patients showed up for their appointments or not. It also reveals a number of characteristics of the patients such as age, gender, neighborhood, No show, etc. The No show is represented by 'No' if the patient showed up to their appointment and 'Yes' if the patient does not show up. This would be further classified as 'showed' and 'not_showed' later on in the analysis for easy identification. 

### Question(s) for Analysis

The following are some of the questions the analysis wishes to explore;

- Question 1: Is there a relationship between the Gender of patients and missing their appointment?
- Question 2: Is there a relationship between the Age of patients and missing their appointment? 
- Question 3: Does being on a scholarship prevents patients from missing their appointment?
- Question 4: Does being hypensive prevents patients from missing their appointment?

## Findings

**Question 1**

It was discovered from the analysis above that the gender of the respective patient does not necessarily determine if they would honor their appointment as about 20% of Female and 19% of Male miss their appointment respectively. Hence, such factor may not be considered as it makes no influence on their appointments.

**Question 2**

From the analysis made, it was discovered that age really does affect the rate at which the patients attend their appointments. Individuals of an average age of 37 do not miss their appointment while Individuals of an average age of 34 do miss their appointments. Also, it was discovered that individuals of ages above 40 often miss their appointments more.

**Question 3**

It was discovered from analysis that being on a scholarship does not really prevent patients from missing their appointments as apperently, majority of those who missed their appointments are those enrolled on the Brasilian welfare program.

**Question 4**

It was also discovered that hypertensive patients have a lower not_showed rate i.e., they do attend their apppointmements compared to those without the health issue.
